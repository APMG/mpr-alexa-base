# MPR Alexa Base

Use this to rapidly generate lambda code for Alexa Skills that stream audio from MPR.

To start a new project, copy and paste the code from inside the `skeleton-sample` directory, run `yarn install` then update the `config.js` values to correspond to your streaming service.

Then run `yarn run deploy` to generate a .zip file that is ready to be uploaded to Lambda.
